# LCDropboxLibrary
LiveCode's New library for talking to dropbox.  Uses the v2 API.  Included with LC 9.0-dp7 and up.
I put it here in case you want to include it with your app in LC 8, since 9.0 isn't ready for prime time, and the v2 API is about to be the only game in town.
LC has this at https://github.com/livecode/livecode/blob/develop/extensions/script-libraries/dropbox/dropbox.livecodescript
